## project
It is a small game contains factory, resource and unit. This game, likes Red Alert, realizes the basic functions such as build, move, collect resource and create new unit.

## shortage
As I finished this project before studying software modelling, the code just realizes the required functions and does not use the knowledge of patterns to modify.
